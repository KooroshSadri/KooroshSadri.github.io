Hi! I'm Koorosh Sadri, a potential theoretical physicist and this website is where I have chosen to exhibit my activities. In general, I aim at finding clear, mathematically formulable answers to fundamental questions in physics. The field can vary in a wide range; from strong-field settings in gravitational physics (eg. Black Holes) to critical phenomena in thermal systems. Recently, I have become interested in - and have been reading about - holographic dualities. I would be glad to hear any comments about any content that you find on this website. (Feel *encouraged* to contact me.) 

Also, if you want to make one of these pages for your own, but (like me) are not an expert in all this, I recommend [Williams' guide](https://jayrobwilliams.com/posts/2020/06/academic-website/). In the unlikely event that you want to use the exact same format as this website for your own, you can *fork the repo* from [here](https://github.com/kooroshsadri/kooroshsadri.github.io). At some point, you will need a quick intro to Markdown syntax, [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUBNt18RFbo) is my recommendation.
