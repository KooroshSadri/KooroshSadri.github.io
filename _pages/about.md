Hi! I'm Koorosh Sadri, a potential theoretical physicist and this website is where I have chosen to exhibit my activities. I would be glad to hear any comments about any content that you find on this website. Feel *encouraged* to contact me. Also, if you want to make one of these pages for your own, but (like me) are not an expert in all this, I recommend [Williams' guide](https://jayrobwilliams.com/posts/2020/06/academic-website/). In the unlikely event that you want to use the exact same format as this website for your own, you can *fork the repo* from [here](https://github.com/kooroshsadri/kooroshsadri.github.io).
