* Alice and her colleagues, living in the pre-general-relativity era, try a series of experiments in flat space-time in order to guess what a gravitational theory would look like. Having heard about Einstein's gedanken experiment involving an accelerating frame, they try to mimic a stationary motion of constant acceleration. As the leader of the team, Alice undergoes a hyperbolic motion described by <br>

        $z = \sqrt{t^2 + 1/g^2}$

    1. Show that her motion in terms of her proper time is given by

            $t(\tau) = \frac{1}{g}\sinh(g\tau)$<br>
            $x(\tau = \frac{1}{g} \sinh(g\tau)$

    Then each of her colleagues, labelled by a number $h$, move in such a way that at
