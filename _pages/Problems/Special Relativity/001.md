* Alice and her colleagues, living in the pre-general-relativity era, try a series of experiments in flat space-time in order to guess what a gravitational theory would look like. Having heard about Einstein's gedanken experiment involving an accelerating frame, they try to mimic a stationary motion of constant acceleration. As the leader of the team, Alice undergoes a hyperbolic motion described by <br>
