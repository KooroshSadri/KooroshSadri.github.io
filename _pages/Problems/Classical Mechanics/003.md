* A rigid sphere of mass $M$, radius $a$, and isotropic moment of inertia $I = \beta M a^2$ has an ant of mass $m=\alpha M$ moving on it; otherwise, the two objects are freely moving and rotating in space. The ant is constrained to move on the surface of the sphere, but can choose its path on the sphere arbitrarily. Let's assume that it takes on a path determined by $\theta(t)$ and $\varphi(t)$ coordinates on the sphere. In the beginning, the ant is not moving relative to the sphere, and the sphere is rotating with $\boldsymbol{\omega}(0) = \omega_0\hat{\mathbf{z}}$. The position of the center of the sphere at time $t=0$ is chosen as the origin of the coordinates. You can express the results in the system of units where $M = a = \omega_0 = 1$.
