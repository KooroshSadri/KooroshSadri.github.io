* A dust particle is stick into the surface of a car's wheel of radius $R$. (This is a 2D problem!)
    1. If the ground is set at $y=0$, and at some point, the dust particle is at the origin of the coordinates, find the parametric equations of the particle's trajectory and draw a graph. This is called a (simple) cycloid.
    1. Now assume that a point mass is constrained to move on the graph you just drew. Neglect all frictions and show that in the presence of a uniform, *upward* gravitational field $\textbf{g}=+g\Hat{y}$, the point mass oscillates harmonically with a time period $T = 4\pi\sqrt{R/g}$
    1. A simple pendulum with (massless) string length of $L=4R$ is hanging (upwards) from the origin. Show that the curve on which the pendulum travels is also a cycloid and use this to calculate the oscillation period.
    1.
