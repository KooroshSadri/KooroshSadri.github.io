* You can find the solution to many of Jackson's problems [here](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~pran/jackson/); I agree with most (but not all) of them. In any case, I am taking a graduate course that follows Jackson's textbook. I will post my completed homeworks here. The problemsets contain a number of tailored problems as well as those from the book.

    * [PSet #1](https://kooroshsadri.github.io/files/solman/jackson/S1.pdf): Tailored Problems + 1.17 + 1.18
    * [PSet #2](https://kooroshsadri.github.io/files/solman/jackson/S2.pdf): Tailored Problems + 2.14 + 2.15 + 2.26
    * [PSet #3](https://kooroshsadri.github.io/files/solman/jackson/S3.pdf): Tailored Problems + 3.2 + 3.3 + 3.5 + 3.7 + 3.11
    * [PSet #4](https://kooroshsadri.github.io/files/solman/jackson/S4.pdf): Tailored Problems
