  * [Abstract](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.06062): We introduce the concept of quasi-inverse of quantum and classical channels, prove general properties of these inverses and determine them for a large class of channels acting in an arbitrary Finite dimension. Therefore we extend the previous results of [[1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.06118)] to arbitrary dimensional channels and to the classical domain. We demonstrate how application of the proposed scheme can increase on the average the Fidelity between a given random pure state and its image transformed by the quantum channel followed by its quasi-inversion.
