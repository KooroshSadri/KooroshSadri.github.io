A fun, nerdy way to spend time is to wrestle with an interesting mathematical problem. Sometimes, after the dust is settled, I find the outcome to be worthy of remembering (by no means, I am assuming that others should feel the same way); and therefore convert the drafty scribbles to a (hopefully) more readable digital file. On this page, you can find a list containing some of those files. (Yes, it also includes a few term papers as well!)
