A fun, nerdy way to spend time is to wrestle with an interesting mathematical problem. Sometimes, after the dust is settled, I find the outcome to be worthy of remembering (by no means, I am assuming that others should feel the same way); and therefore convert the drafty scribbles to a (hopefully) more readable digital file. On this page, you can find a list containing some of those files; it also includes some of my term papers/reports. (A ðŸ”’ symbol indicates that the note will not be updated anymore.)

* While studying quantum field theory (QFT for short), one faces many *do-it-yourself* calculations. In [this file](../files/notes/011.pdf), I will try to do those calculations as clearly (at least to myself) as possible. [Last Update: Jun 2021]

* ðŸ”’ [This](../files/notes/010.pdf) is the Persian report of my BS thesis (for the electrical engineering course) titled *"Phase Transitions in the Community Detection Problem: An Information Theoretic Approach"*.
