A fun, nerdy way to spend time is to wrestle with an interesting mathematical problem. Sometimes, after the dust is settled, I find the outcome to be worthy of remembering (by no means, I am assuming that others should feel the same way); and therefore convert the drafty scribbles to a hopefully more readable digital file. On this page, you can find a list containing some of those files; it also includes some of my term papers/reports. (A ðŸ”’ symbol indicates that the note will not be updated anymore.)

* While studying quantum field theory (QFT for short), one faces many *do-it-yourself* calculations. In [this file](../files/notes/011.pdf), I will try to do those calculations as clearly (at least to myself) as possible. [Last Update: Feb 2022]

* ðŸ”’ [This](../files/notes/010.pdf) is the Persian report of my BS thesis (for the electrical engineering course) titled *"Phase Transitions in the Community Detection Problem: An Information Theoretic Approach"*. [Last Update: Jun 2021]

* [Here](../files/notes/009.pdf) you can find a term paper that I wrote a while ago on the issue of rigid body motion in relativstic physics. [Last Update: Dec 2020]

* [This](../files/notes/008.pdf) is a drafty version of many of my calculations in the field of general relativity. It contains most of my work for the Physics BS project I did in 2019. [Last Update: Dec 2022]

* ðŸ”’ While working on the Quasi-Inversion project, many little lemmas were proved; [this](../files/notes/007.pdf) is one of them. [Last Update: Feb 2021]

* It is easy to make a paper cylinder but impossible to make a paper sphere. "What is the general rule here?" I asked [Behzad](https://www.linkedin.com/in/behzadhaghgoo), my high school friend, and he came up with a rather beautiful conjecture; [this](../files/notes/006.pdf) note is a proof for his (generalised) conjecture. There are a few open (at least for me) problems here as well (Cf. [Problems](kooroshsadri.github.io/problems) tab). [Last Update: Apr 2019]

* ðŸ”’ [This](../files/notes/005.pdf) is a model that proves the poorer one is, the more decent he is as well. (Of course I am kidding!) [Last Update: 2017]

* ðŸ”’ I am interested in the sphere packing problem. In 2017, I published a Persian review [here](http://physics.sharif.edu/~takaneh/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Takaneh28.pdf). [This](../files/notes/004.pdf) is a neater version. [Last Update: 2017]

* ðŸ”’ As a term paper for the course Quantum Mechanics II, I wrote [this](../files/notes/003.pdf) concerning the Lamb effect. [Last Update: 2017]

* You are given a bunch of noisy data points in the form of many (say 1000) dimensional real vectors. But you know that they all lie on a possibly curved low dimensional (say 7) manifold. How would you estimate the true intrinsic dimension? [This](../files/notes/002.pdf) is one method that I developed in 2017. [Last Update: 2017]

* ðŸ”’ As a term paper for the Fluid Dynamics course, I wrote [this](../files/notes/001.pdf) concerning Kolmogoroff's 4/5 law.

* ðŸ”’ On the first encounter, I found the numerical method *"wag the tail"* (as explained in Griffiths' Quantum book) interesting and therefore applied it to solve the energy levels of a particle in an infinite triangular well. ([here](..files/notes/000.pdf)) [Last Update: 2015]
