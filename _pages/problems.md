Apparently, David Hilbert has -just before his *23 problems* lecture in 1900- said something that people translate as
> *"... a mathematical problem should be difficult in order to entice us, yet not completely inaccessible, lest it mock at our efforts. ..."*

You won't find *those* problems here, instead, some that I find interesting. A question mark (❓) denotes the problems that I am yet to solve!
