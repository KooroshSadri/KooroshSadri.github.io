Research Statement
=====



Education
======
* BS in Physics, Sharif University of Technology, 2021 (GPA: 3.70/4.0)
* BS in Electrical Engineering, SUT, 2021 (GPA: 3.68/4.0)
* IPhO Preparation Course, Young Scholars Club, 2016
* A Level, Helli High School, 2015

Research Experience
======
* F. Shahbeigi, KS , M. Moradi, K. Zyczkowski, V. Karimipour; "Quasi-inversion of
quantum and classical channels in finite dimensions", *Journal of Physics A: Mathematical
and Theoretical*, 115691.R1 (2021), [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.06062)

Unpublished Work
-----

* EE BS Thesis: During the 2021 spring semester, I did a research project titled *Phase Transitions in the Community Detection Problem: An Information Theoretic Approach* under [Mohammad Hossein Yassaee](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Y6vuiBUAAAAJ&hl=en)'s supervision.
* Special Relativity Term-Paper: I did a thorough review of several historical and modern papers on the issue of rigid bodies in relativistic physics. You can find the paper under the [notes](http://kooroshsadri.github.io/notes) tab.
* Physics BS Project: Under [B. Mashhoon](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Yj0-pX4AAAAJ&hl=en)'s supervision, I re-derived and discussed some of the solutions to Einstein's field equations in higher dimensional space-times. You can find a drafty note, reflecting my calculations and results under the [notes](http://kooroshsadri.github.io/notes) tab.
* Sphere Packing: On the Pi day of 2016, Maryna Viazovska solved the problem of optimal sphere packing in 8 dimensions, a week later, Henry Cohn *et al.* used a similar method to solve the problem in 24 dimensions. I, being interested in sphere packing, did a thorough review on the state of the art methods and results. The resulting paper was published (in persian) [here](http://physics.sharif.edu/~takaneh/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Takaneh28.pdf)
