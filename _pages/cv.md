Education
======
* BS in Physics, Sharif University of Technology, 2021 (GPA: 94%)
* BS in Electrical Engineering, SUT, 2021 (GPA: 90%)
* IPhO Preparation Course, Young Scholars Club, 2016
* A Level, Helli High School, 2015

Research Experience
======
* F. Shahbeigi, KS , M. Moradi, K. Zyczkowski, V. Karimipour; "Quasi-inversion of
quantum and classical channels in finite dimensions", *Journal of Physics A: Mathematical
and Theoretical*, 115691.R1 (2021), [arXiv](arxiv.org/abs/2104.06062)

Unpublished Work
-----
* EE BS Thesis: During the 2021 spring semester, I did a research project titled *Phase Transitions in the Community Detection Problem: An Information Theoretic Approach* under [Mohammad Hossein Yassaee](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Y6vuiBUAAAAJ&hl=en)'s supervision. We hope to publish the results soon.
* Special Relativity Term-Paper: I did a thorough review of several historical and modern papers on the issue of rigid bodies in relativistic physics. You can find the paper under the [notes](kooroshsadri.github.io/notes) tab.
* Physics BS Project: Under [B. Mashhoon](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Yj0-pX4AAAAJ&hl=en)'s supervision, I re-derived and discussed some of the solutions to Einstein's field equations in higher dimensional space-times. You can find a drafty note, reflecting my calculations and results under the [notes](kooroshsadri.github.io/notes) tab.
